Will I finish this? maybe, maybe not. but I sure as hell will try.
### planned features
1. you can only use buttons a certain number of times
2. Better gameplay
3. Sfx
4. Background music
5. enemies
6. enemy ai
7. difficulty settings
8. main menu screen
9. settings
#### are any of these actually going to be implemented? maybe? maybe not? I don't really know. if i can focus, maybe half or more will get done.
